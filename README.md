# Stroke Data & Predictions

## Overview

Welcome to the Stroke Data & Predictions project! This repository features a comprehensive analysis of a stroke prediction dataset, conducted as part of my NTI Data Analysis Training. The project includes detailed visualizations and a predictive model using Random Forest.

## Project Highlights

- **30 Key Insights**: In-depth analysis with 30 visualizations revealing significant patterns related to stroke occurrences.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Development of a Random Forest model to predict stroke likelihood based on various factors.
- **Key Findings**: Insights into variables such as age, hypertension, glucose levels, and more.

## Notebook

- **`stroke-data-30-insights-visualized-with-ml-model.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, visualizations, and modeling. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-Abuslama/Stroke_Data_30_Insights_Visualized_with_Random_Forest.git

## Getting Started

**Open the Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open `stroke-data-30-insights-visualized-with-ml-model.ipynb` to explore the analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

- `id`
- `gender`
- `age`
- `hypertension`
- `heart_disease`
- `ever_married`
- `work_type`
- `Residence_type`
- `avg_glucose_level`
- `bmi`
- `smoking_status`
- `stroke`

## Analysis and Modeling

The notebook covers:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key insights and trends related to stroke occurrences.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing and evaluating a Random Forest model to predict stroke likelihood.
